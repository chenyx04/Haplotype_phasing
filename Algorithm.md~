# Spectral-Stitching Algorithm

The Spectral-Stitching algorithm consists of three stages:

**Stage 1: node splitting and spectral estimation.**  Split all nodes into several *overlapping* subsets, and run spectral
methods separately on each subgraph induced by each vertex subset, in the hope of achieving approximate estimates for each subgraph.

**Stage 2: stiching the estimates.**  The aim of this stage is to stitch together the outputs of Stage 1
computed in isolation for the collection of overlapping subgraphs, so as to ensure that they have matching global phases.

**Stage 3: successive local refinement.**  Clean up all estimates using both backward and
forward samples in order to maximize recovery accuracy. This is achieved by running local majority
voting from the neighbors of each vertex until convergence.

This algorithm is shown to be information-theoretically optimal for various statistical models with locality. Details can be found in the following paper:
