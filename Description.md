# Haplotype Phasing


Humans have 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes, which are identical except on certain positions called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A haplotype of an individual is the pair of sequences of SNPs on the two homologous chromosomes. Knowing the haplotypes of individuals can lead to a better understanding of the interplay of genetic variation and disease as well as better inference of human demographic history. The haplotype phasing problem is that of inferring haplotypes of individuals from high-throughput sequencing data. 

The Spectral-Stitching algorithm consists of three stages:

**Stage 1: node splitting and spectral estimation.**  Split all nodes into several overlapping subsets
