# Description


Humans have 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes, which are identical except on certain positions called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A haplotype of an individual is the pair of sequences of SNPs on the two homologous chromosomes. Knowing the haplotypes of individuals can lead to a better understanding of the interplay of genetic variation and disease as well as better inference of human demographic history. In this talk, we discuss the problem of inferring haplotypes of individuals from high-throughput sequencing data, and present an efficient algorithm that is information theoretically optimal. The design and analysis leverages connections between this problem and the problem of community detection, where communities have to be inferred based on the friendship graph of users.
